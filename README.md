# Cloak

Cloak is a Chrome extension which simplifies your web experience by blocking unwanted images or elements from your favorite web pages.

Sample use cases:
* Hide elements and images that clutter your viewing space.
* Block ads that manage to bypass your ad filters.
* Block comments for a more sane web.

## Details

Modifying 3rd party web pages, without prexising knowledge of the DOM
can be a trickly proposition.  Page layout can change overnight, CSS
quirks can collapse elements unexpectedly, etc.

Cloak helps out by providing a useful toolkit:
* Rules can be inspected, modified and applied at runtime.
* If you are unsatisfied with the last rule, you can easily 'undo' it.
* You have a choice to completely remove the element or simply make it "invisible" to maintain the structural integrity of the page.

Cloak can be installed from the Chrome Web Store: http://goo.gl/2NIrW.
